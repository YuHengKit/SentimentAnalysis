" Face your fears and take action. Tackling your challenges usually includes facing one or more fears. You can try to avoid facing your fears, but at some point they will circle back into your life and you'll have to face them again. You can ignore fear, but you can't escape it. Learn to be courageous and deal with it once and for all. Being courageous doesn't mean you become fearless. Everybody experiences fear. It's just that courageous people are the ones who are brave enough to constantly face their fears. On YouTube there is a Will Smith interview in which he states: úIf something frightens me, I have to do it. I will not let it control me!‚ Taking action is the most important step in this whole process. It is also the step where most people get stuck. But by creating the right mind-set this becomes a lot easier. Because the emotions that usually frighten you and maybe even paralyze you will no longer have any effect on you, or the effect will be greatly reduced.",1

"	As for dealing with my life, I use a more practical and systematic method. Due to insufficient time, I manage my time and try plan everything's work to avoid wasting time. Moreover, I try my best to finish everything according to my plan. This is because I do not like procrastination. In terms of money, I become more budget-conscious and will not simple waste money.

Sometimes, in order to discuss homework, my group members will follow my time and wait for me until afternoon to discuss together through Google Meet. Google Meet is a platform that allows us to communicate face to face during MCO. During discussing of our group assignment, we will share the information we found and give opinions. After that, we will assign work to everyone and stipulate the time to submit our assignment, so that we can hand in on time. Besides that, I will also use the afternoon time to visit one-stop shop to buy daily necessities and groceries such as fruits, vegetables, meat and others.

"	Before pursuing my Masters, I asked a lot of opinions, advices and tips from people who have successfully graduated while working. Majority, if not all would suggest to have proper routine and discipline. Routine can shape the real self and discipline can make you a great person. How do I cope with this? I can say that I am still crawling, unable to successfully adapt discipline into my routine of life. To build a successful in full discipline and dedication needs practice and I am still learning. One of the ways that I recognize is to always set my body clock. Just like the saying early bird gets the worm, this same concept applies to my life as well. When I wake up early, there are so many things that I can achieve, spiritually and occupationally.  Knowing what my priorities are essential to make sure I am able to submit all my works according to the date and specification.  The problem I have currently lingers around the problem of procrastination, lack of discipline which leads to the difficulty of managing my work and study. For some of the works that I was able to finish earlier, really made me feel satisfied and not being under stress means that I can breathe and still feel happy and content with my life. Inconsistency and procrastination are my biggest enemy that I should always fight. My hope is to be able to be more discipline, focus on the important tasks and continue doing it without stopping for pleasure before finishing it. The duration for an assignment is so long and there is no reason for me to be unable to process it. ",2
"	Besides that, the second challenge is the relationship with my partner. Due to MCO, my partner and I have to stay at home and work from home. Both of us are busy. I need to be a housewife, mother, student and teacher. Sometimes, I do wish that my husband can be more understanding about my work. We argued most of the time at home because he always complains that I look at the handphone all the time and neglect my kids. In fact, I need to reply my students' message. In addition, I have to complete my assignments and face the examination. I argue with him because I think that he can help me more especially in household chores. It is not a good scenario where my kids always look at us when we have some argument. I think that it is not a healthy relationship. It affects my kids too. Sometimes, I find that my eldest daughter will argue with her brother. We have the bad model to them. Indirectly, they learn something bad from us.

"	Cognition merujuk kepada proses mental dan kemahiran berfikir yang membolehkan seseorang belajar dan melakukan sesuatu dalam kehidupan seharian.  Dariapda pengalaman dan pengetahuan yang ada pada saya, cabaran demi cabaran telah saya hadapi dan tempuri.  ",2
"	Cognition which closely related to mental processes or thinking skills that allow people, learners like me to learn and function in daily life, especially to the extent of at home, in the community, at school and work as well as in our relationships. Taking this course teaches me that some of the main types in cognition include attention, memory, processing information, solving problems and planning or organizing. These skills overlap with each other and work together as bits of information enter the brain, processed and acted upon. Like mentioned above, one of my main issues in juggling between study and working is to maintain my attention. The biggest problem is having trouble concentrating on a task for a long period of time. I easily get distracted, especially when many other things happen around me. To help me cope with this problem is the first to, not to put too much demand on my attention span. I need to keep things simple, direct and to the point. For instance, I can only spend ten minutes on this task at a time. I have also learnt that paying attention is not as simple as it seems. Paying attention involves two separate functions which are the ability to focus on things that matter and the ability to ignore the things that do not matter. These two are distinct and separated processes in the brain. These processes are so separate; in fact, there are different networks of brain structures that carry out their respective functions, each of which is critical for attention. If either of these brain processes is impaired, we lose focus, I lose focus. I really understand that my inability to focus is much of the inability to filter out distraction, not my lack of concentration. ",1
"	Distraction often happens internally and externally in my life. One thing that I practice to maintain my well-being is to check up on myself every day and practice self-care. For example, endlessly ask myself, what is happening, how do I feel, what cause my emotional feeling toward the event, and reflect on what I should or could do to make it better. Turning off voice and notification have been a long practice since years ago as I am consciously aware of the unwanted distraction is annoying to me. Recently, google analytic and digital marketing have been conquering social media with tones of advertisements which also affecting the original intention of surfing social media. Sometimes, I withdraw myself from social media to detoxify my thoughts and prevent to get hook as to when scrolling social media it does bring impact on my wandering. The distraction will continuously bring forward to the next task after surfing and affect productivity. Recently, one thing that I learned is to have productive learning by scheduling short breaks in between study and work. It does make some changes to my past practice of doing work for a long time without a break. Taking a break, such as a walk for a few minutes away from the desk, prepare dinner or watch some documentaries, helps me to relax my thoughts and refocus on work after the break. It helps to reflect how far I have gone for my work and continue with that momentum. I am a person who sits in front of the desk for a long hour and is lazy to get sweaty. So, I will always exercise in front of the working desk by moving my legs and arms, node my head, shake my hand, etc. to relieve the pain on my stiff necks and shoulders. Next, listen to Mozart instrumental music does help me to concentrate on my work. I also listen to different instrumental music frequently because it helps me to relieve my pressure and get a peaceful pace and calm my mind by immersing myself into the soft music rhythm. Sometimes, I play a musical instrument to release my stress as well. It helps a lot to reduce my stress and get a clear mind after the play. In sum, I could say that taking care of myself is vitally important to maintain my well-being because I am responsible for my feelings and emotions. No one could understand better than me. So, by recognizing my state of health could enhance my cognition, affection, and behaviour throughout my development.",0
"	During MCO, I try to spend time reviewing my attitude towards work. I found out that I am actually not so resistant to Information Technology. My lack of confidence makes me feel like avoiding it most of the time. So I made up my mind to overcome this problem. I change my mind and ask my colleagues about the method to use Google Classroom. I also take initiative to go online to find relevant information and watch the video to learn. At the same time, I often encourage myself not to give up but to believe that I will succeed in the end. Today, not only I can  design different types of exercises, I can also help students solve the problems they encounter in technology. My self-confidence has slowly grown. I also start to enjoy online teaching. This change made me more aware of what I can do if I want to.",2

"	During night time, my husband will help take care of my son, so I can concentrate in completing assignment. Sometime, when I face problems in teaching, I will ask my colleagues to teach me the method to use Google Classroom or I can find advice online. This night time is very important to me because I can do my own thing. However, sometimes when my son cries, I still have to put down my work to accompany him. Usually,  I will wait for my son to go to sleep before I continue the unfinished assignment. Therefore, I often go to bed late because I have to use my sleeping time for my assignment.",0
"	During RMO, I did not do much to maintain my well-being. Living in a kampong, I only managed to rake the leaves around the house and that had made me sweat enough. If living the previous normal, I would join my friends going to my aerobic class and workout class. The classes that I joined must be indoor and specifically for girls only. Growing up, I as well realize that I am a very private person and feel so shy around others who may be doing exercise in public. This well might due to my weight previously; which was very heavy and being teased during teenage years had made me realize that I might have a very low self esteem. Spiritually, I am really happy and glad that I am born into my religion, Islam. In fact, this is one of the best things that I am grateful that I get in my life. I try to maintain my religious life by watching and listening to all the Islamic talks and I have read and collect all the books that is closely related to me spiritually. I am happy that my best friend aka my father, loves to share and read the books with me. This just makes me feel at ease and glad that my loved ones would love to share the same love and interest with me. By reading a lot of books, especially learning this course has helped me comprehend myself psychologically better. Self enhancement book also has helped me a lot and thoroughly.",2
"	Everyone has 24 hours, including me. Before MCO, I usually feel time is enough for me and I always have extra time to do what I like. However, during MCO, time becomes a luxury for me. I need more time to deal with many things. Therefore, I need to have wisdom in managing my time so that I can have a balance life for my work, study and family.",2
"Getting distracted unnecessarily is frustrating because it affects the productivity and challenges to meet the deadlines with slower reaction time and memory retention. When the due date is around the corner, and I have the intention to focus on finalising it, the distraction can ruin the concentration. Stress might be one of the factors in my inability to focus or overcome the distraction. My brain might produce cortisol (stress hormone) which can cause aggression and impulsive behaviour. Fortunately, cognitive psychology knowledge helps me to notice how my attention works in time and space. I also make me aware of my distractibility level, identify what works and doesnët, and make adjustment accordingly to make sure I could be in a better form to utilise my cognition and affective competency and problem-solving skills. Despite, it is helpful in some way, but sometimes, I failed to withdraw from the distraction until the stimuli are absent. Get distracted easily can be caused by overwhelming and invincible feelings to a long queue of to-do lists. It happens when I am to give up before I start. Our mind wires the preserve energy whenever is possible. If I do not have to complete the work or tasks, I might need not to do it. But I allow myself to get stuck into distraction. With that selection of decision, get distracted forces my brain to multitasking in a sense. It is proven by neuroscientists that learning new information while multitasking is not beneficial as the information will transfer to the wrong part of the brain. It reduces either of the information retentions. During multitasking, the brain consumes excessive oxygenated glucose when shifting the attention. If the changeover getting back and forth between tasks too frequent, I will feel exhausted and off-track. I listen to music to cover the sound interruption when I get distracted sometimes, but I often get exhausted. From another point of view, I get distracted easily maybe I am not fully engaged in my work. I feel like I am working hard the whole day sometimes, but my mind might be fighting over boredom. If I enrol in a complex task which requires more of my attention and working memory, which mean I might have less mental capacity remaining to wander to the external distraction. When a more challenging task is assigned, it might push my skills and limit and generate a hyper-focused tendency on my work. From different perspectives, distraction can perceive as a positive element which gives my brain some time to relieve pressure on something and refocus. For example, when I get distracted, I can stop my work and focus on other work, such as house chores, to have some break. When I free up myself, my brain has more free time to repair the problems. With the stated above, it reflects my executive attention system was involved in dealing with the situations by controlling my attention and dealing with conflicting responses",0
"	Hence, I started to do my work in my way. After, I felt refreshed and I was ready to start all my pending works. I revisited my daily schedule and made changes. I focused on key priorities and dropped a few things had caused me anxiety and stress. I ensured that I had a balanced schedule for work, family and myself. I protected myself from feeling anxious when others were interested to build up their business or build up skills. I tried to help others and be supportive to others. I assisted others in their time of need by providing help. For example my neighbours, Mr Supa and Mr Raman discussed in whatsapp group to hand over some donations to people who lost his job during MCO. They started to collect some donation and I contributed too. 	",2
"	I am living with my mother and second brother during the MCO period. Usually, there are only my mother and I staying at home. My second brother is working in Singapore. He will only back home during the weekend. But he was ordered to stay in Malaysia for work during MCO. One of the biggest challenges that I have to face during MCO is to deal with the distracting environment created by my family at home. A few situations are happening that are considered extremely distractive to me when I am studying or doing my work in my room. First of the condition is that I could hear the loud TV sound came from the living room where the sound frequency can penetrate to my room. Second, my brother always plays music loudly outside of my room. Thirdly, the noise that came from my brother and his friend when they are playing in the living room, which the gathering situation should not be allowed during the MCO period. Usually, I will fully utilize the facilities in UTM such as the library to have personal time for study and work purpose after class. Unfortunately, MCO has made some drastic change to the normal.",0
"	I am very grateful that MCO give me time to stop and rest within my busy lifestyle. It also gives me opportunity to know myself more in life. I used to think I am a person who can handle stress well, but when there are too many things to deal with, I become very stressed and unstable. At first, I try to deal with everything at one time but I fail. When I understand my own cognition, I learn to do things at my ability, not only things are settled, my emotions can be manage well. This made me understand that I need to do things according to my ability and pace. Therefore, every time before I go to bed, I will arrange the work for the next day step by step. In this way, no time is wasted and everything can be done on the same day. In my financial, I will management give priority on buying the necessary food first and try to save on the usage of water and electricity. Since masks and hand sanitizer are out of stock, I will try to buy them through various channels.",1
"	I need to manage my attention within both internal mind-wandering and external environment events every day. Unpredicted events will always be occurring or surrounding me. It wont go anywhere, such as birdcall, thunder, fan spinning sound, and rain sound, etc. I perceive attention management is significant in life. Despite distraction attention affects my productivity, I have to learn to overcome and take control of the distraction. I believe it is one of the best things that I can do for myself. In the situations stated in Q1, I perceive I am experiencing a Stroop effect. The task-irrelevant stimuli are powerful to grab my attention. Perception and attention enhance my competency to know about the stimulus and take action on. In the context of the studying process, what would happen if I make value out of the interruption? Would it helps my brain refocus and decompress my brain for a moment? What would happen if I manage the stress under control, such as relax the mind or practice breathing? Would it help to regain focus and overcome distraction? What would happen if I make an effective plan for task complexity and priority? Will it enhance my processing capacity, perceptual load or working memory? What would happen, if I make a quick change in planning when I feel bored or get distracted easily on my work? Under the uncontrollable environment when the distraction is diverse and frequent such as the people passing by, peripheral sights, and sounds, etc., would express inattention work? Would breakdown tasks into small goals enhance focus and generate a sense of reward for accomplishment and progress on the work to minimise waste of time or frustration? Would I less likely to be distracted if I work on high-load tasks? If the environment is unchangeable, I might have to change the external environment. Self-reflection can cultivate and nurture my cognition, behaviour and attitude to overcome the encountered distractive attention and reclaim my focus. One of the good cases practises is that I silent my phone when I am on work. It could control the external stimuli and work effectively on me. Besides, I started to set a daily goal from the overwhelming tasks on sticky notes to make sure I am clear with the type of work that I will be working on and arrange a suitable time for each. When I set a deadline on the breakdown task, I have a strike of focus and avoid distraction in any way possible. I figure out alternative ways to enhance my working memory and get hyper-focused when I know I have to get somethings done on time. The practice of self-assessment helps me to put a curb on the distraction. When I am paying attention to my thoughts and understand that my mind was distracted allows me to manage what I should prioritise to focus on and redirect my thoughts before it gets worsen.",1
"	In addition, I understand that it`s not easy to admit that we have problem. But I must trust myself, my partner and family. Therefore I need to accept that argument is not the hardest step. There`s no harm in talking about it with our family. I discussed this with my wife. We try to accept the truth and the reality during MCO. My wife and I had a similar feeling as we missed our routines, students and friends. My wife told that she missed her family members who are staying in Perak. She didnt meet her parents for more than 6 months. When we started to discuss, I realized that my wife was worried about her family too. I try to understand her situation as a mother, as a wife and as a teacher who is struggling to control her emotion. So I can understand about others perception too. The outcome of our discussion, I noticed that I didnt argue with my wife for simple issues. I also can control my anger and didnt show it to my children or wife. ",2
"	In dealing with teaching, I think I have done it right because I choose to calmly face my inner fear, that is lack of confidence. Moreover, I am willing to change my old thoughts, try new things and let myself gain new knowledge. This change is a big breakthrough for me because it is actually difficult for me to change. Besides, I also have the patience to teach students. At the same time, I am happy to help parents or students who face problems with technology. In doing these things, I no longer tired but I am willing to do it. This is where I found myself changing the most after I understand my cognition and face it. Therefore, I think that the cognitive psychology has helped me a lot.",2
"	In my study part, cognitive psychology allows me to see that past bad memories can affect the way I look at my future. For example, due to my previous failure, I become lack of confidence in things that I am not sure about. This discovery made me see that it is my lack of confidence that made me think that I am not good at English pronunciation. I am determined to work hard in this regard. At the same time, I also know that I am a person easily affected by things around me. By knowing this, I purposely pay special attention when recording my assignment so that I will not be disturbed. Beside that, it helps me to analyze the problem so that I can find a better way to solve the problem of group assignment. ",1
"	In order to make good use of limited time, I divide my time into three parts for my work, family and study. These three parts are morning time, afternoon time and night time. When I wake up at 5:30a.m., I will start doing housework such as washing sons clothes, preparing breakfast and others. I try to finish my house chores while my son is sleeping. In this way, I will not be disturbed by my son so I can concentrate on my stuffs. After that, I will prepare my teaching work such as prepare some practice questions for students, write lesson plans and mark my students work. Sometimes, I will also need to reply questions sent by my principle or send messages to parents. I try my best to finish my teaching work in the morning. When my son wakes up, I need to give my son full attention to teach him his homework and play with him. After that, I will help my mother-in-law to prepare lunch. This is what I will do in the morning.     ",1
"	In the case of online teaching, the knowledge of cognitive psychology helps me to see clearly that my lack of confidence is because my negative preconception feeling that learning new technology is very difficult. However, I decided to change my mind and give myself the ",1
"	Learning about cognitive psychology is an advantage on how to conduct my thinking and to learn about parts of my brain really makes me understand the complexity and the beauty of our brain. One of the many things that help me to cope with the challenge of studying alone is to understand that studying a small amount of material at a time is a smart move. This is important so that I can minimize the interference created from other information that I want to encode into memory. This is much applied on the knowledge of working memory and long-term memory. When I need to study multiple topics in the same study session, its best to study topics that are as different as possible, as this helps to avoid interference from related information. Besides that, I need to apply the concept of semantic memory; which does not just store entries like a dictionary; they are stored like an interconnected network. By having these ideas connected, thinking about one concept can help me remember related concepts. Firstly, outline the main topics I want to study and arrange them as a hierarchy, showing how specific ideas are related to broader ones. To make things easier to remember, I try to keep all knowledge limited to as few words as possible. Another point is, learning cognitive psychology which teaches me that I can test my memory. The act of retrieving information from memory can affect how I can remember the information later on. Doing it over and over quite often strengthens the memory.",2
"	Learning cognitive psychology not only allows me to increase knowledge and understand more of myself, it also allows me to learn to look at things from different perspectives in my life. In the beginning of MCO, I felt a sense of oppression and emotional instability because actions were restricted and too many things had to be handled at once. However, when I look at it from a positive perspective, I am grateful for it because it gives me more time to spend with my family during MCO. I can also schedule the time accordingly. I began to enjoy working from home. At the same time, I also have the opportunity to learn cooking skills from my mother-in-law. This not only saves money, but also able to prepare healthy and delicious meals for my family everyday. My relationship with my mother-in-law has become better. ",2
"	Lukas Herrmann, one of the study authors and a researcher in social neuroscienc† used to said: ""You need to know yourself to understand other people.""†This shows that it is so important to understand yourself.			",1
"	MCO happens unexpectedly and the first time it was announced, it was scheduled for a week, which started during the school holidays. The same holiday that first time I planned to stay in Batu Pahat to finish my incomplete works as a teacher. I will not forget the day our Prime Minister announced it, and I quickly called my sister in Selangor to purchase a bus ticket to Batu Pahat one day before the MCO started. We were so glad she was able to safely reached Batu Pahat and our family would be one again soon. As planned for the school holidays, my mother and my youngest sister would be staying in Muar, at my grandmother‚Äôs. My grandmother is bedridden now and my mother would like to take care of her. We followed her suit and together my middle sister and I, joined them at kampong. And this is when my struggle started. Imagine a two storey house where the combination of wooden and stone, a typical old house. The biggest challenge that I faced during MCO is the weather. I have never, in my life, felt so hot and burned in a house. There was not even one place that was cool enough for us to rest, let alone doing work. The heat was agonizingly painful and we would have to shower and lie still on the floor just to feel a little cool. Cooking and eating were always in sweat, let alone doing work. I could not do my work, study or anything in between during the day. At night, when we switched on the lights, insects and bugs from all over the world it seemed, would came by and occupied the space. To find a comfortable place to study itself is so painful, though every day, we are grateful to have a place to live. Even with this difficulty, my sister and I forced ourselves to set up a place and only study during the time we were able to tolerate the heat. Talking about kampong, which meant totally not in uptown scale, the internet coverage is one of the toughest things to get here. Only two companies offer the available coverage here, and I have spent money to buy another new sim card just to get ahead of what is going on. Another massive challenge that I find out during MCO is to finding the motivation. I am always inspired by people who are successful, and the drive to be a thoughtful and intelligent learner will motivate me to do better. However, during MCO, none of this comes out. I rather read books on religious matters, or just be in my cave rather than facing the reality of on what my priority is.",0
"	On my English speaking, I often feel that my English is not good enough that makes me afraid to use English for presentation. To overcome this problem, I ask my husband to guide me how to pronounce word by word. I also use technology to learn pronunciation while listening. Slowly, I became more confident. In order to focus, I choose to record my assignment at night time because it is more quiet. Although it takes me three days to record, but when I saw the result, I feel it is very worthwhile. Besides that, when doing group assignment, team member and I use google meet to discuss. This way allows us to share our ideas on the spot without time constraints. We can see the problem through the skills of google meet and immediately correct the error. It virtually made me realize that I liked to discuss assignment face to face, so that I would understand the requirement of assignment.",1
"	Other than my work, my daily life is also affected. The working hours are not like my usually working hours at school. Since my work place is changed to home during MCO, I have to adjust my time so that it will not affect other aspects of my life, such as housework, take care my son, do assignment and so on. At the same time, I also have to make time to supervise my sons academics because he cannot go to kindergarten during this period. This adjustment makes me feel that time is not enough because too many things are waiting for me to deal. This also indirectly affects my mood.",2
"	Personally, knowing cognitive psychology helps in understanding a specific process and moment that is working behind the scene. In the case stated in Q1, cognitive knowledge allows me to identify the situation as a distraction attention condition. I perceive that I could not attend to one event (studying) when another event (sound distraction) is happening and respond to the situation accordingly. The challenge is how to apply the knowledge into real life and generate solutions to solve life problems with the knowledge acquired to make it valuable. I am aware of the things that I am focusing on under distraction which my neurons are responding to the external audio stimuli impacts my perceptual ability on specific tasks. Maybe the work on hand is a low-load task causes a remaining perceptual capacity in my brain to process the task-irrelevant stimuli, and get distracted. I also reflect, am I too sensitive to sound? When the car and neighbour pass by, I could hear the sound and conversation from my room. Often, it is hard to get back to the task when I am interrupted by the stimuli. I have to keep starting over and over again. It is ineffective with my low ability to return to work after I got distracted. Forcing myself to progress under the distractive situation is unproductive as well. But I am also concerned about how I could manage to tune out from the distraction. From my past experiences, I try to relax and identify the things that caught my attention when I realized I got distracted a lot. I reflect, why am I so curious about the task-irrelevant stimuli? Knowing what is the external stimulus that I could and could not change help me to progress in some way. For example, silent my phone and put far away from my workplace is controllable and efficient because I know I will get distracted when the notification rings. Even a single sound could interrupt my thought process and ruin the effort. Apart from a controllable stimulus, there are situations that I could not control. I have to change my perception towards the stimuli. For example, try to move my workspace farther to where the sound comes from, be inattentive to the stimuli, try to tell myself to ignore the disturbance and focus on work or listen to instrumental music, etc. One thing that I did to push my limit over the distraction is to continuously remind the deadline of the tasks that I have to meet. It works, but the effect is inconsistent.",2
"	Similarly, I also encounter different challenge during MCO such as learning to teach online at home, insufficient time, my finance is in trouble and I am unable to discuss face-to-face with my team members on my assignment  and so on. Although these challenges seem to be a lot, but I believe they can be solved one by one as long as I persist. ",0
"	The mentioned situations in question one (Q1) are the most difficult situations that I have to face and deal with the distractive feelings that I felt. It is unavoidable to deal with the situations living with family. I understand that everyone has the things that they want to do at home, but I expect it to be no influence or disturbance to other people within the space. With the expectation, when the situations occur, I will always confront them that it interrupts my focus on work. I also request them to lower down the volume or even provide suggestion to plug-in headphone for a win-win situation. Unfortunately, it often being ignored. Knowing the environment is unchangeable, I tried an alternative to plug in the earphone and listen to instrumental music to cover over the disturbance sound, but I hardly focus on the study or develop thought process for work. I have had tried to tell myself to ignore the voice and focus on my work, but the sound interruption has such a strong effect on my cognition. Sometimes, it engenders my frustration and helplessness feeling for unable to change or control the condition. The struggle within myself is, why I could not focus on my work and easily get distracted by the sound interference? I reflect they are just doing the things they preferred. There is nothing to do with me. It might be my problem to get trigger by the sounds. It is inefficient to cope with the distractive situation in a forceful condition. So, I focus on my work when there is no sound distraction to make sure I can perform my work effectively with my thought process. When there is a distraction, I will try to daydream, sing, play music instrument, do house chores or take a nap to overcome and make sure I fully utilise my time. The third situation is where I could not take it anymore. Gathering during the MCO should be avoided, but my brother invited friends over to play at home until late at night. The laughter and game sound remain until midnight 3 to 4 am. It powerfully affects my sleep quality. I tried to tell myself to ignore the sounds, blank my mind and fall into sleep to get rid of the stimuli. Sadly, I failed to withdraw from the interruption until they leave. I ponder over the situation, how my mother could sleep under this annoying condition? Is it my problem in dealing with this situation? Are there individual differences in the ability to deal with distraction? Is the effort that I put in insufficient to withdraw from the interruption?",0
"	To maintain my healthy spiritual health, I will look for deeper meanings in my life and through analyzing occurring patterns, it helps me to see that I have control over my destiny. I often do relaxation exercises and prayer to improve my state of mind and outlook on life. At the same time, I will view things in my life in a positive manner, slowly I find myself thinking differently and able to refocus my mind to a happy and healthy place.",1
"	Wayne Dyer said that Change the way you look at things and the things you look at will change.ù Firstly, try to change a fixed mindset to a growth one. Our mindset is the ideas and attitudes that shape the way we think about ourselves and the world. Our mindset affects the way we behave, our outlook on life, and our attitude towards everything going on around us. In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This is illustrated that I always try until I get the result I want. I keep searching the information online and discussing with friends while doing the assignment. Thus, it takes a long time in completing an assignment because amendment would be made frequently until less erroneous. Willingness to learn from the people around me is another example. Yi Lin and Shih Min, whom I always seek the advice and suggestion are very willing to teach me.",1
"	We would face many challenges and problems throughout our life. The most important is how we perceive ourselves dealing with those challenges and overcome them. Here are some methods I would like to share.",1
"	When dealing with my studies, I found out that I am a person who want to solve a problem fast whenever I encountered any problem. This can be seen from learning pronunciation and doing group assignments where I am very determined to find an appropriate method to solve the problems. Through cognition understanding, I realize I lack of confidence in myself, so very often I do not believe in myself. Fortunately, I am a positive person that makes me willing to face everything bravely and make the impossible possible. Besides, I also saw that I am someone who do not give up easily. This can be seen from the three days I spent recording. Therefore, I consider myself successful in dealing all my challenges by applying cognitive psychology.",2
"Accept and let go. Accept life as it is now. It doesn't matter how many or what kind of challenges you are facing. See them as opportunities for growth. This way there is no point in feeling bad about them anymore. They are here to help you. Accept yourself as you are now. may have flaws, may have made mistakes that have contributed to the situation you are in now, but that is not important. Let go of your past and forgive yourself. All that counts is what you do in this moment! Let go of fears, stress, and frustrations toward this situation and the people involved, even if think someone else is to blame for situation. Feeling anger or hatred toward this person will only (negatively) affect yourself. How do you accept and let go of things? With a simple exercise called meditation. After four years of daily meditation I can vouch for the fact that it is a very effective tool for getting rid of stress, negativity, frustration, and anything else that is not serving you. Learning to meditate is the biggest gift you can give yourself.",1
"After discovering the problem, I manage to cope with my life well. I need to balance my time with my family, work and study. It is not easy but slowly I made it. ",2
"After having the knowledge about cognitive psychology, i learn more about how people think and process information not only helps researchers gain a deeper understanding of how the human brain works, but it helps to solve my problem. ",2
"After knowing about my own cognition, it slowly helps me to cope with my challenges. The biggest change on me is my own emotion. I become a happier person. I don't get angry easily. As a result, it affects my family members too where I don't argue with my husband and I don't simply lost temper on my kids. ",2
"After knowing the causes of my challenges and problems in attention, I found out some indicates concentration and attention with problems in me during MCO such as not enough of concentrate, easily distracted and feel bored. In order to cope with the challenges, I tried use some strategies to help me with focusing my attention. I had limited the time spent on any given task. For example, I spend 15 minutes on a task at a time to prevent put too much demand on my attention span. Second, I had tried to focus one thing at a time. I also give myself take breaks to prevent me from becoming overwhelmed by challenging tasks. Besides that, I also tried to limit distraction by simplify the environment. For example, I tried to do revision at night or do my tasks in my bedroom to removing distractors such as noises and conversation of family members. Moreover, I also use the day planner to help me in organize to do my every task. ",1
"After my survey, 95% of family neither have computer or printer at home. All they had only a smart phone with limited data access. I am a preschool teacher, and my students all were new learner. It was impossible to request them to copy the question on exercise book because some of them even don't know how to hold a pencil or draw a particular line. All I could hope is their parents or grandparents. At the end, I comprised to use an alternative way which was recording the lesson and send to parents via application of Whatapps. On the very first day of virtual online teaching, I needed parents to draw the picture question for their children and they were all in helpful. The first day of virtual teaching was succeed but there were still some sound of grumbling from their parents.  ",0
"After the child falls asleep at night, finally i have my úme time. At this time, i can attend to my own emotional needs; read a book; enjoy a movie; pamper yourself. Recently i have a new hobby, that is to play with micro size blocks. Every time i feel stressed, i will play micro size blocks in the middle of the night. When i finished a building block, i felt very fulfilled and the pressure was relatively reduced.",2
"All in all, understanding own cognition and trying to find out the ways can solve the problem that I faced in my life.",2
"An unpredictable outbreak-COVID-19 broke out and swept the world, included our country-Malaysia. COVID-19 has caused our government and medical staff  a huge loss and made  people panic. This is because COVID-19 can be easily transmitted and the rate of infection is very fast. Furthermore, there is no medicine to control the outbreak yet. The most worrying thing is that COVID-19 is not easily diagnosed. This is a big challenge for front line medical staff. In addition, this epidemic is very explosive and can cause people to lose their lives. Therefore, our government decided to implement Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18th March 2020 to prevent the spread of the epidemic. Even until now MCO is still practice to prevent the second wave of outbreaks.",0
"Another challenge for me during MCO and real-life experience is it is difficult to let the students to think outside the box. They don't have the creativity to propose a creative idea. I have been teaching English for eight years. I discovered an issue where students lack of idea and they cannot propose a fantastic idea. If you want to have good ideas you must have many ideas. Most of them will be wrong, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away‚Äù. (Crick, 1995) My students are facing the problem as they don't have the ability to generate ideas. As a result, they don't have good ideas. For example, I always ask students to predict an ending of the story. They can think the ending based on their creativity. However, I always feel disappointed with their answer due to their creativity.  ",0
"Another challenge is the learning environment. During MCO, I spent most of the time at home. The environment at home is very comfortable for me to relax. I feel free to rest and eat at home and nearly broke the routine of daily life. Obviously, this environment at home is not suitable for learning. A lot of distractions in home like television, food and bed affect my focus in studies. Therefore, the efficiency of learning was very bad during MCO. I tried and failed to achieve the understanding most of the time. ",0
"Another cognition I can relate is learning and memory. Learning is when we pick up new information or skills while memory is the process of storing knowledge and skills and recalling them. Everyone has ways they prefer to learn new things or in theories we called it as learning style. I would prefer to learn by listening and doing which it makes my understanding better. Usually I will listen to Youtube any information needed and jot it down so that I can memorize what I have listened. I also prefer to learn in the morning and in a quiet environment to make myself focus and concentrate without any distractions. In conclusion, understanding my own cognition helps me to cope my works easily. ",1
Are our children really affected by this? When teachers suffer chronic stress and depression their attitude  towards  their  students  is  poor  and  irritable.  They  are  less  sensitive  to  the  children's issues and become less involved in the learning process. ,0
"As a mother , a teacher and a master student ,the challenges that i have to face throughout MCO is multi-tasking and scheduling. I need to working from home during the MCO has them wearing many hats ... simultaneously: making sure work work gets done as fast as possible. My headmaster is very efficient. He asked us to complete the task he gave in the shortest time. Sometimes, he will set deadlines for those tasks during MCO. During this crisis period, in addition to work, i had to take care my family, which put a lot of pressure on me.",0
"As a preschool teacher, attention is a part of crucial component in teaching. Children love the interesting learning method and eye-catching subject to attract their attention. This make the lesson become easier and meaningful. The meaningful knowledge will be remembered more lasting and store in long term memory because it related to episodic memory. The episodic memory is the memory of daily event that can be explicitly stated. For example: the virtual science class during MCO is floating experiment. The child is able to list out again the floating and sinking objects and even can explain the whole experiment process. This is because of the episodic memory.     ",1
"As a remedial teacher, I am responsible to teach students who are weak in study especially in subject Bahasa Melayu. Most of my students have difficulties in remembering the knowledge that I teach in class. For example, they learned how to spell ‚Äúgajah‚Äù today, but they will forget on the next day. The knowledge of short-term and working memory in cognitive psychology helped me to understand the reasons. My students have weak short-term memory which affect their study. I used repetition approach to help them in learning. In this approach, I trained them to read and write the same words or sentences every day. I changed the words after make sure they can transfer the knowledge from short-term to long-term memory.  ",1
"As a teacher who worked in the primary school, the closure of school means I have to change my teaching norm in respond to this changes. All teachers were encouraged to build up a class communication group by using WhatsApp and also create online learning platform via Google classroom. Honestly, I seldom give my phone number to parents as I always hope to have my private time out of working period. But now I have to change my mind and accept the reality as I have to assist students and also parents to settle their problem within almost 24 hours a day.",1
"As the old saying goes, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Exercising is another method to maintain well-being. Exercising not only can improve physical health due to sedentary, but mental health as well. Excerpt from article ‚ÄúThe disease that robs us of ourselves‚Äù in Reader‚s Digest Magazine, August 2012, exercise is known to be anti-inflammatory and older adults who exercise regularly are at lower risk for cognitive decline. I do Tabata exercise at least 4 minutes until 8 minutes per day to maintain my body health and also to keep fit. I feel so at ease and things are clear after exercising and eventually happy.",2
"As they say time and tide wait for no man. Throughout the MCO, I not only have learnt to pay more attention in my tasks but also learnt to manage my time effectively. Furthermore, I also learnt to take care of my family member at home. I think the cognitive psychology that I had learnt very useful in my life because it revolve on studying mental function and the mind such as memory, learning, perception, attention, language, reasoning, decision making and conceptual development. Knowledge is power and knowledge is the best tool for self-improvement and understanding myself. So, I want to learnt more about the cognitive psychology and apply it in my future from time to time.  ",2
"Attention problems can make me difficult to focus at my work and my studies. The memory problems make me struggle to handle the my course work. I felt depress when i struggle with my course work, the negative thinking can interfere with my health and happiness. I will felt down and easily lost my temper. We all experience these negative thoughts from time to time, but after having the knowledge about cognition psychology, i can overcome with the pessimistic thinking in daily life. ",2
"Because of limited of time and everyone bears heavy responsibility, I have to plan the time wisely and fix a date for discussion and make sure that every discussion comes out with fruitful outcomes. According to my past experience, it is quite difficult for all to discuss if without any preparation before this and it must uses up much time to discuss every single thing. Some more, my group members may do not have much more time to think the proposal owing to they are immersed in other works, such as house chores and school works. Thus, I would plan whole the proposal and write down the ideas on a piece of paper for easy to discuss. This makes us easy to discuss, easily modify the ideas and stimulate others' opinions. After discuss, we split the assignment into parts and everyone takes their own parts to do. Thus, I think that this is a better way to curb the challenge.",1
"Because of MCO, I realized the important of technology and I am going to teach students about the little information of the use of technology because it had become part of life. The statement which stated that the powerful of technology is undefeatable. ",1
"Because of virus covid-19, Malaysia is entering a new lifestyle such as social distancing, no school life, and even work from home. The life became struggling when all the works and life gathered together. The working environment was tougher than before as theree were a lot of noise in house, such as television's playing sound and kid's talking sound. But,   it isn't hard to maintain a good condition of physically, psychologically, and spiritually if I knew myself well and following the suitable instruction. ",1
"Because the study atmosphere was home, which surrounded by lots of sound such as mothers cooking sound, sisters chatting sound, televisions playing sound and so on. But what I felt lucky was that I had learned how to focus myself on task and refuse distracting by others. Mastering the attention skill was the best part in my academic life because it helped me a lots during this crisis time. Studying, teaching and maintaining work-life balance are hard, but paying attention on task helped me to settle down one by one easily and quickly. In contrast, I will lost a lot of precious time if I was attention divergent. ",2
"Besides that, I learnt about daydreaming, solitude and mindfulness in cognitive psychology. By knowing all these terms, it helps me a lot in my psychologically. For example, using daydreaming to enhance creativity is to know how to harness its power. One way to do is to take a break from what I am doing and purposely let my mind wander, an activity which I‚Äôve seen has been linked to creativity (Baird et al, 2010). The actions I can do are take a break, take a shower, take a walk and pay attention to my mind wanderings. Therefore, when I feel I can‚Äôt take it anymore, I will let my mind wander. I realize that one of the benefits of solitude is that it can help avoid distractions. Kaufman and Gregoire say that ‚Äúsolitude isn‚Äôt just about avoiding distractions; it‚Äôs about giving the mind the space it needs to reflect, make new connections and find meaning.‚Äù Therefore, I have a place to be alone, away from distractions and stay there for long enough to give my mind space to create ideas. Besides, mindfulness helps me to pay attention to the present moment. I meditate regularly. It helps me reduce stress and enhance my creativity.",2
"Besides that, juggling within works, study and life were another big challenge for me to cope with. Before MCO, my life was on stable routine which was teaching and hitting to gym. But during MCO, I had to learn preparing teaching works a day before, and standby whole day for replying students homework. It had used up a lot of my time and sometimes I had to squeeze my midnight time to some home-workout. My routine was not ruined at the end after I managing my time and my perception. By dividing the time fairly and equally, I was able to cope with works and physical time. ",0
"Besides that, understanding my cognition helped me to form impressions. In this context, my experiences from accept to overcome challenges were reduced down to the concepts and ideas that I needed. Therefore, my experiences became fundamental in brain as guidelines to face the incoming challenges. ",2
"Besides the perception that I mentioned in Question 3, as I knowing attention, it helps me to cope with my challenges. Attention brings different effects on the brain. It increases activity in areas of the brain that represent the attended location. Sometimes, I will ask myself ‚ÄúCan I attend to more than one thing at a time?‚Äù It is because I have so many roles and so many tasks need to complete. So, I train myself to be a multitasking person. From the textbook, I read about experiments by Walter Schneider and Richard Shiffrin (1997) involved divided attention because they required the participant to carry out two tasks simultaneously. However, divided attention becomes difficult when the task is made too hard. For example, I need to take care of my kids and do online teaching at home. Both are difficult tasks for me especially when my kids are crying. It distracts my attention. The environment is full of distractions. As a result, it reminds me need to focus on one thing. After settle with an issue, just continue with the next issue. Step by step, it helps me to cope with my challenges. ",2
"Besides, having a emotional, cognitive and psychological positive are important in daily life. Life will be dimmer if we stuck ourselves in negative thought and emotion. By knowing myself well, I will practice continuously on something I rare in such as baking and online learning. Repeating the skill will transfer it into long term memory can make everything easily and in ordering. Hence, when I succeed in new skill, I will be happy and willing to do it no matter what. An example here as what happened in MCO, I was not a good learner in kitchen and I even did not recognise the name of food‚Äôs materials. So, I felt frustrated when I was going to bake a cake. So , I tried hard to practise endlessly, and at the end I succeed in baking a tasty cake on my own. The feeling of success had brighten up my emotional and psychological, and this is the way how I maintain my psychological positive. ",2
"Besides, I also maintain to keep my psychological healthy throughout MCO. At the beginning of MCO, I felt stress when the routine of daily life out of control. Daily life filled with a lot of new challenges from works and study. Luckily, I found ways to release these tension. I liked to play my favourite computer games after works and study, while sometimes I listened to soft music. These activities were helpful to release my tension and keep my psychological healthy.",2
"Besides, I am learning to understand students, parents and public from their perception about the worrying on academic level. As the severe Covid-19 cases increasing continuously, the school is prohibited to reopen and even the tuition center. A lot of parents had started to work from May but the school was still closed until end of June. No more parents guiding transform into tenser situation. As a teacher, I am not going to blame either students and parents because I know it is so hard for virtual learning even through the videocall. The students attention is not stable and they cannot understand the concept without real interaction and learning. In an addition, some parents are undergraduate, they couldnt help much in their children academic and their stress level are triggered. ",0
"Besides, I become more patience and passionate to my kids and my students. I will try to put on their shoes and think for them. As a result, I won‚Äôt get mad with my kids and students. The relationship with my kids become stronger. My students also discover my changes. Sometimes, they will joke with me. They prefer the current me which I won‚Äôt easily lost my temper. After dealing with challenge, I put more effort to plan my lesson. My students enjoy the lesson during MCO. ",2
"Besides, I encountered the challenge when having online classes with weak internet connection. Weak internet connection is a big challenge to conduct online classes. Weak connection affected the efficiency of interaction in class. I cannot listen clearly and always missed some points in classes. Therefore, I cannot learn and fully understand some topics on the spot. I need to review notes after the classes finished. Therefore, I experienced bad learning processes during online classes. ",0
"Besides, I had a lot of arguments with my wife. This was most challenging periods because my partner and I stayed at home and worked from home. I felt that she didn't understand my situation who always spend more time only to buy groceries. She argued a lot because didnt help her in house chores. She complained that I liked to spend my time outside and looked at the hand phone all the time. When, I uploaded my teaching materials in Google classroom, I need to use my phone and laptop. ",0
"Besides, I have learned to say no to people and things that will negatively affect my work and my studies. Social media like Facebook and Instagram are really can be a time-killer. Every time when I want to search for an information by phone, I would easily get distracted by the social media notifications which appeared on the phone main page. So I have to discipline myself to avoid spending a lot of time on social media. I have to set my phone to silent mode when I need to focus on my assignments or study to avoid being get distracted.",1
"Besides, I meet another challenge in teaching. Before MCO, I teach a student who encountered difficulties in writing in space given. For example, he wrote out of the box in exercise book and cannot colour pictures within the line. These difficulties affected his learning processes. Before learning conceptual knowledge in Cognitive Psychology, I did not know how to cope with his difficulties. I used repetition approach to give the student practice. However, my approach failed to help him. This was because I was lack of knowledge in conceptual knowledge to help him. After learning conceptual knowledge, I have more understanding about his difficulties. I realized that he encountered difficulties in the concept of spacing. He cannot limit and adjust the spacing when writing and drawing. Therefore, I conducted some hands-on activities which involve the spacing concept. For example, I planned ting ting games for him and ask him to jump in the box without stepping on the line. This activity trained his concept of spacing well.  ",2
"Besides, I noticed that problem- solving method also useful for me as a primary school teacher. Most of my students are staying in rural area and their parents are not afford to use smartphone. Only few students are able to attend the online classes and others are not able to follow up.  It was unsolved issues until second week of MCO. Hence, I tried to overcome the issue by using alternative way. I bought few set of questions and notes. I also prepared worksheets and photocopy it. I asked help from few teachers who staying nearby the students house to collect the questions and hand over to the students. I hope that the alternative way will solve the issues. I also called and got update from students who received my notes and worksheets. ",2
"Besides, I prepared a daily to do lists. In this list, I wrote down daily tasks to complete. Tasks arranged from the most to the least important one. After that, a checklist prepared to check the progress of tasks. To do list and checklist helped me to make sure all the listed tasks were completed. Therefore, I would not missed tasks either in works or in study.    ",1
"Besides, in order to solve the problem caused by the movement control, we use the online chat, such as WhatsApp to conduct a discussion. It is easy for us to discuss if the Internet is smooth and stable. Sometimes, my group members face the Internet problem and may miss out something we discussed. Therefore, I have to find some way to help to solve this problem based on my past experience. I would continue to discuss the assignment with the other members who do not face the Internet or device problem. Then I would type it out in our group for view. Otherwise, I would record the whole conversation and send to our group for record and reminder for all.",1
"Besides, when I faced with something which I could not settle by myself, I will search for the help from others such as my family and friends. We could not expect we can handle everything perfectly in our live. Appropriately seeking help from others can make our live easier and we could be healthier spiritually and psychologically.",1
"But chasing knowledge was unstoppable,   I had attended several online learning classes through application of Zoom, Google Meet and Webex. These were a new learning style for me and I never experienced virtual class. The stabilization of home internet, the substained attention and other little things around were the big issues for online learning.",1
"But this daily routine had bored me after some times, so I would interchange with some interesting activities to light up my life such as watching drama which I desired for so long, or baking in the night time. Baking was a new learned skill during MCO. With baking, my brain was refreshing and more functioning while remembering the steps to bake a chiffon cake. Several times of failure had restructuring my brain knowledge and rearranging the useful information about baking. ",2
"But, I was naive when I found out this sudden outbreak was not a good news for me even for any citizen in Malaysia or within all human in this lovely world. There was a virus which called Corona-19 attacked silently and speedy throughout the whole world and caused thousands of life or even more! ",0
"But, Stay-At-Home was typically a wonderful moment for family bond up time. So do I. Besides working and my own physical gym, I also took out some times for family bonding because I knew this was a perfect time for this. So, I spent my night time with family such as baking, or watching drama together. ",2
"But, without supporting from friends and family, I think I couldn't make my life meaningful. Learning a new skill needs a lot of supporting because they could give me strength and power when I am upset. For instance, the burden of work was more stressful during MCO, because we had to assign attention to different aspect such as the content of academic, the pedagogy teaching method, the level of understanding on student, the internet problem, the natural disturbance from environment and so on. All of these mixed up together and formed a big and invisible stress. The support from family had strengthen me when I was stress. They give me physically support such as helping me in household cleaning, preparing meal when I am busy and so on. A deepest thankful and grateful to all of them who had supporting me no matter in physically or emotionally. ",2
"By knowing my own cognition from different aspect of attention, working memory, category formation and recognition, I was able to cope my lots of assignment assigned between works and life. With the present of Covid-19, whole Malaysian include me were requested to stay at home until the virus condition in controllable level. Thus, I failed to attend any academic and physical classes during this 3 months of MCO . ",2
"By understand my own cognition to my weakness, I can cope with any challenges easily.",2
"By understanding my own cognition in my ability to solve problem, I managed to cope with my stress in life. I try to identify my negative thoughts and behaviors that increase my stress burden and the situations where stress occurs. For example, the challenges I met was the new teaching and learning norms during the MCO period and I did really feel stress when I need to learn all new things to deal with the new norms. The feeling of taking learning new things as a burden is my negative thought. By having this negative thought, I will feel stress and unhappy easily. So, I have to change my negative thinking patterns and replace them with a more positive and realistic one. As I should take learning new knowledge as part of my growth of life and is a chance to improve my self-competence.",2
"By understanding the mechanisms of perception, memory, attention, thinking and solving problems is useful in almost all professions. It helps me to develop my own thinking and reflection and see some of my own biases. I feel that i am quite successful in facing these challenges. ",2
"Cabaran kedua ialah ibu bapa tidak tahu cara-cara menggunakan Google Classroom. Walaupun saya telah menerangkan cara-cara log masuk Google Classroom, tetapi masih ada ibu bapa tidak faham kerana mereka kurang mahir menggunakan platform ini. Oleh itu, mereka tidak berhenti-henti hubungi saya. Saya telah banyak menerima telefon dari mereka dan saya sudi mengorbankan masa untuk mengajar mereka. Walaupun telah lewat malam, tetapi terdapat segelintir ibu bapa masih menghubungi saya. Saya telah menggunakan satu minggu baru selesaikan masalah ini. Hal ini telah mengganggu masa rehat saya.",0
Cognition refers to the mental processes or thinking skills that allow people to learn and function in daily life. Understanding my own cognition helps me to curb the challenges effectively.,2
"Cognitive Psychology helps me a lot in my teaching life and my daily life especially during MCO because I learn from the different perspective. Different people have different brains and thinking.  I realize that different people have to deal with different techniques. Before we cope with a challenge, think the best way to solve it first. ",1
"Cognitive psychology involves the study of internal mental processes -- all of the things that go on inside our brain, including perception, thinking, memory, attention, language, problem-solving, and learning. Having the knowledge about cognitive psychology does really help me to cope with the challenges that I am facing now. ",2
"Cognitive psychology is ‚Äúthe study of mental processes, which includes determining the characteristics and properties of the mind and how it operates.‚Äù (Goldstein, 2018) Hence, I always ask myself ‚Äúhow it operates‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy do I make this decision‚Äù when I try to solve the problem. After learning about cognitive psychology, I understand about the mind creates and controls mental capacities such as perception, attention, and memory and creates representations of the world that enable me to function.

"Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes, which include determining the characteristics and properties of the mind and how it operates. Understanding cognitive psychology is an important to help us gain a deeper and richer understanding of the many mental events that contribute to our daily existence and overall well-being. I feel very fortunate to have access to the subject of cognitive psychology because I can use what I have learned to overcome the challenges I face during MCO.",2
"Communicate with employer. Communicate openly and honestly about how i handling everything. University is demanding enough as it is, so make sure I straightforward about availability and state any concerns i might have. Be vigilant of this, and don't overextend yourself. If don't have enough time to commit to a part-time job, can check out alternative ways to make money. ",1
"Day by day, I discover that I started pay more attention in do my work, manage the time well and finish the tasks more effectively. I have to maintain physically, psychologically and spiritually well-being lifestyle also. Sometimes, I carry out Zumba dance at home with my mother to maintain our body health. It is not only keep my family and I body health but also reduce the risk of COVID-19. I always pray to God for healing people of all ages and stations of life from physical, mental, and spiritual ailments and hope that the Covid-19 pandemic would end soon.",2
"Definitely yes, the knowledge about cognitive psychology helped me to cope with the challenges now. The knowledge applied to cope with the challenges in my teaching.",2
"Depending on ones environment and the values was taught growing up, a person will develop an inner guiding voice and there is tendency to be harshly self-critical. Each of us has our different background of life which lead to the way how we were taught. It is very important to stay positive in any situation just to make sure we think rationally. Unfortunately, the perception we have of ourselves also can influence our behavior. Have you ever feeling the value of you are not good enough before? Yes, I did for so many times. But I will always remind myself nobody is perfect in this world. You can't have satisfied people in decisions you made and made them agreed with it. In conclusion, the one who knows ourselves better is us. ",1
"Due to the impact of this epidemic, schools cannot be opened from 18th March 2020 until now. In order to not affect the learning of students, the education bureau instructed teachers to conduct online teaching in their own homes. For me, it is a challenge because I know nothing about Information Technology. I also have not learned how to use Google Form to make exercises in Google Classroom. So, it is a very challenging task for me and I do not have confidence to learn it. Besides myself, I also need to teach parents of my students on the way to use Google Classroom so that they can guide their children to use it to answer questions designed by teachers. If students encounter problems with online learning, I need to help them solve the problems. For some students who do not have internet, I need to send the practice questions to them via SMS. Sometimes, I have to send the latest news to each parent for their updates. This virtually increases the amount of work I do and makes me feel out of breath.",0
"During MCO , the life was struggling with lots of works, academic studying, physically exercise, life interference, worrying from parents and stress from superior authorities. Every challenges had been settled down one by one with diligently and patiently. The method to deal with struggles were simple and easy, which were calming down and find alternative way. ",1
"During MCO, a lot of distractions in home reduced my concentration in works and study. To cope with this problem, I set a work and study space in my home. I set rules for myself in this space and I shared the rules with my family members, so that they can help me to cope with this problem. If I broke the rules, I will lose one of my meal in a day as punishment to myself. These rules were useful to increase the efficiency in works and study.",1
"During MCO, i have to wake up early, cook breakfast and work while the kids were still asleep. Bacause once they wake up early, they would constantly demand my attention, asking for milk or food throughout the day. The kids also complain that they're bored and ask me play with them, even when im in the middle of the meeting with principle, discussions with my colleague or trying to prepare a report. I used to cook just two meals a day. But now that all of them are home all day, im preparing food and snacks throughout the day. ",0
"During MCO, my husband cannot work and has no income, I have to be responsible for the family expenses as well. This burden makes me very cautious in spending money because I am afraid of going over budget. This worry makes me find that spending money is challenging. Another thing that makes me feel challenging is I cannot buy masks and hand sanitizer. During MCO, the government requires people to wear masks when they go out and also encourages people to wash their hands with hand sanitizer to prevent epidemic infection. Therefore, people become panic in buy masks and hand sanitizer causing them to be out of stock. It makes me very annoy and frustrated.",0
"During MCO, stay healthy and alive is the most important mission for everyone. I built some principles to stay healthy lifestyle, so that I am strong enough to keep away from virus and sicknesses. ",1
"During MCO, students have been prohibited to having classes at school and campus, alternatively online classes become replacement. Regarding to delivery knowledge efficiently and help students to acquire and encode knowledge in their mind, all the teachers work hard together and trying to make online classes more interactive and fun. Knowledge about cognitive psychology can explain well how people think and process information, and how the memory is formed in our brain. It also provides a number of ways to encode the knowledge into our long-term memory, such as elaborate, generate and test, organize and take breaks. Let‚Äôs say that Dr. Narina always shares the interesting video in e-learning which is a way to impart the knowledge for us because video is a recording of moving pictures with sound. It makes us easier to understand and easier to encode the new knowledges.",1
"During Movement Control Order (MCO) due to COVID-19, I have faced many problems that baffled me within this long period. The challenges that I have to face are the problem of limited time, movement control and device.",0
"During the MCO, some of my teachers had to return to their hometowns, where the Internet connectivity may be unstable. Hence, we decided to use Whatsapp Video Calls to conduct e-learning sessions for our childcare centres and kindergartens. There will be three children for one session of voice call. For example, if the class has 12 students, the teacher will conduct four e-learning sessions based on the same daily teaching plan.",1
"Every teacher need to conduct teaching process through online classes during MCO. So am I. Before discussing the ways to cope with the juggling work and study, I would like to list out the works during MCO. Besides teaching, I need to handle some technical problems coped by my students and parents. I also communicated with parents about their children's homework. These works happened out of the working hours. Therefore, I forced to make changes in daily routines from time to time during MCO.",1
"Everyday i had supervising my eldest daughter, second daughter and third son home-based schooling. It took me a lot of time to accompany my children to do their homework. I have tried to supervise three children to do their homework together at the same time, but every time i feel very upset and easily get angry. I can't control my own emotions. So i chose to supervise my children to do their homework individually. It took me a day to supervise their homework. Everyday i am in a state of tension.",0
"Expressing what is on your mind will help you to maintain a focused mind. After a long day or a significant event, you may feel confused and not be able to make sense of your feelings. By writing down your thoughts, you may be able to think clearer and move forward.",1
"First of all, a good time management is very important to me. I know my time management skill is always my weakest part and since all teachers were required to start online teaching from 1April 2020, I have to divide my time wisely. I have marked all the school work and assignments deadlines on my calendar in case I won‚Äôt miss any work. Besides, I have forced myself to create time to study in my schedule to ensure that I can follow up my studies. Sometimes, though, my actions don‚Äôt keep up with my thoughts. As preparing online teaching aids takes time and spending long time in front of computer makes me feel tired easily and no more energy to read the books. But I will try my best.",1
"Firstly, I chose to aware with the challenges. At the beginning of MCO, I chose to keep myself away from the challenges. I always found accuses to relax at home to keep myself away from the challenges. However, I realized that I still needed to face those challenges to prevent accumulation of works and delay in learning. Therefore, I found ways to face those challenges positively. I read an article in the website to introduce 3 greatest ways to perceive yourself dealing with challenges. I found the sharing in the article are useful to me. ",2
"Firstly, I faced the toughest challenge is the internal challenge which is self-discipline in learning process. I experienced freedom at home during MCO. This freedom caused me to lose my self-discipline in learning. Self-discipline includes my focus, attitude and routine in learning processes. Before MCO, I managed to focus my learning in routine classes. During MCO, most of the classes conducted via online. In this situation, I feel difficult to focus. I managed to have self-learning and do revisions after the online classes. However, my weak self-discipline caused me to give up self-learning many times. Therefore, lack of self-discipline was a big challenge to me during MCO.",0
"Firstly, I make a schedule for myself and try to stick to the schedule. A schedule is a great way to figure out my priorities and the amount of time I need to get everything done. I have scheduled my daily routine accordingly. For example, I wake up at 7am every day and I would read book for at least one hour before taking my breakfast. After breakfast, I would start doing my own affair, such as doing assignment or conduct Google Classroom for students. At 4:30pm, I would do Tabata for at least 4 minutes until 8 minutes. Thus, I hope that my daily life is at a work-life balanced state.",1
"For centres that do not have any problem with the Internet, I recommend using an app like Zoom. The suitable ratio should be a maximum of seven students for one teacher in each session, since the screen size will become smaller as more students are involved. Early childhood education focuses more on the process instead of the result. What appears on the screen is important to ensure a meaningful e-learning session. This e-learning method is suitable for children aged three or above.",1
"For example, when I felt frustration, it can cause me to find fault in my family members. When I frustrated about something or someone, I started to blame others for it and if the more faults I see the more frustrated I become. Therefore, I understood that whatever our emotions tell and it`s better not to follow our emotions to handle the situation. Earlier, I felt frustrated about my students who didn't complete my task on time.  But once I learnt to accept their situation, I can overcome my feelings. I changed myself to be more supportive with my students. I ensured that I have a good quality communication and provided accurate information to my students. I asked about their problems and always keep in touch with the parents too. I provided some donations to the parents in order to help them to overcome their financial problem.",1
For few times I had experienced the network problem and can't connect to the online classes. But it did not inhibit me from learning. The alternative strategies was found by using mobile instead of computer. This is because my mobile internet was smoother than home internet. ,1
"For me, cognitive psychology has revealed a lot about human cognition: how easy it is both to remember things and to construct a false memory or forget something, how our cognition is full of errors and still surprisingly good enough and adaptive. It is interesting to see how our perception is based on earlier information and how our decisions can be based on trivial or flawed information.",1
"For me, future is part of things which I really care about it, not only the goals but also my psychology and spiritual. I want my life is full of positive vibes so I am trying in every single step and way. I know it isn‚Äôt hard to make it if I able to balance my work-life. ",2
"For me, I am not a work-addicted-person nor a bookworm but a busying person between work and life. It was a step to become a better me as I will know how to cope with stress and busy. The emotional was a very important part in everyday, if I failed to control my emotion, I would lose my assiduous work. ",1
"For me, I know I can't resist from any physical activities including cross-fit, playing badminton, yoga, home-workout and so on. So, I will squeezed out two hours for refreshing from the busy lifestyle. I am addicted to the feeling of sweat, it make me feel so relieve and refresh. I like to practising yoga at morning hour because it restart and refresh my mind and be energetic for the whole day work. Sometimes, I will jog at park nearby. Running in the scene of beautiful sunset, surrounded by bird singing sound are totally delighting me. Physical activities improving metabolism and refreshing my structure of mind-web. For keeping social distancing, I started to practise exercise at home and I found out home is another best place for sweating with just a yoga mat and exercise tutorial from youtube. Having the physical activities 4 times per week isn‚Äôt hard, what make it harder is the destabilize mind.",1
"For me, it is necessary to plan what you are going to do for the next day and upcoming days. Before I go to sleep, I love to reflect myself what I have done for today and what will I do for tomorrow. Usually I will set in my mind for the next day's plan that I need to finish my reflective essay for Cognitive Psychology, cook fried rice for breakfast, do some house chores. That is how I will make sure my plan is done according to what I have set a day before. I am still single, unmarried. I am pretty sure, a student who already married and have children are much busier compared to me and I salute to all working, studying mother out there. There is time a pile of workloads come in one time. I started to depressed and clueless where and what to start first. First thing first I need to calm down and take a deep breath. All human has been given 24 hours a day to fit in with beneficial activities. People who loves to waste time is the one who loves to do nothing in a day. Thus what I need to do is schedule my-to-do list and prioritize the most important thing to complete. ",1
"From my perception, life was not only filled up by works and study, but with some physical activities. The physical activities included fine motor and gross motor skills so playing puzzle was another interesting activities for me to refresh from daily work and study. ",2
"Furthermore, we are not allowed to go somewhere as we like during this period. This is a troublesome problem because we are not allowed to gather at some place and causes us having difficulty in discussing assignment directly. Alternatively, we use online chatting to discuss our assignment yet still having problem, which is every time just a member can speak out otherwise it would be very noisy. Misunderstanding arises when sharing ideas because other members cannot imagine and understand when someone is talking at another side. Sometime, the Internet is very slow and unstable. We are forced to sign in to the conversation again. It takes a longer time for us to finish discussion compare to face-to-face conversation. Frankly, face-to-face interaction is easier for us to discuss and sharing our idea.",0
"Get enough rest and prioritize your health.Remaining healthy both physically and mentally is key! Keep in mind that are still growing, and need to take special care of your health. Sleep a minimum of 7 to 8 hours, or at least try to. This will strengthen your immune system, benefit your memory, and help you cope with stress much better. Also, be sure to eat nutritious food throughout the day to keep your energy up. We get that takeaway can be tempting, but while you're balancing your busy schedule, try aiming for a more balanced diet as well!",1
"Hence, I also apply this method in conducting online classes for my students. I always look out interesting ways and learn some technique to attract my students attention because students attention is short and poor concentration. For instance, I use quiz to test my students understanding because testing on material students have studied pays dividends in improved memory. I also would give the students a short break when they are tired.",1
"Hence, I also try to make myself happy by finding new hobbies. I learnt to play carom through you tube. After that, I bought a carom board from shop. I decided to play carom with my father and wife. We fixed a time. After tea break, we will sit together to play carom. I tried to get my parents and my wife`s attention. We enjoyed playing it. So I can spend my valuable time with my family. Sometimes I will play carom with my children too. They had fun and at the same time they practiced skills like counting, reading, visual perception, and eye hand coordination. ",2
"Here was my daily routine during MCO. On daytime, I was busy settling my teaching job via video recording, explaining and replying homework through Whatapps until afternoon time. After that I would hit up to a perfect workout time in the evening with the beautiful sunset scene which had able to calm myself and run out from hustle and bustle work. Another reason was Im a gymaholic and it was a daily routine for me. At the night time was the studying time to finish all my assignment and paperwork of master course. ",1
"High levels of teacher burnout prevent the teacher from developing and maintaining a positive attitude  towards  the  students  and  their  specific  needs.  This  can  lead  to  children  being  less involved  in  the  learning  process  and  less  motivated  to  study.  Many  difficulties like dyscalculia, dyslexia, emotional issues, autism symptoms, etc might be overseen, leading to a delay in therapy and cognitive training. Recent research has suggested that teacher stress can be contagious making the students and other teachers more anxious. A burned out teacher has lost interest in teaching and education. These levels of exhaustion have made the teacher more flexible or rigid to certain conducts making them less coherent in their discipline. Children also tend  to  copy their teachers  mood so if a teacher is depressed or angry the child might exhibit these behaviors at home.",0
"However, we are starting to see some difficulties when conducting e-learning sessions. The kids are beginning to lose focus and become more difficult to control. This is expected as they are still young and the virtual medium limits physical contact between teachers and their students. The children tend to get bored quickly due to the limited interaction. Being at home also made them more dependent on their parents. They demonstrate better self-esteem and more consistent reactions in a face-to-face class.",0
"I also have prepared a planner book for myself and I would make notes the important events on the book, especially record all the examination schedules, class times, work times, study time, due dates, appointments and other obligations. In this way, I would try allocating my time to do assignments according to the due dates to prevent procrastination. Procrastination may lead me to piling up of work at last minute.",1
"I also keep myself healthy by doing some exercise like walking around and jogging around my neighbourhood. I liked to walk 2km with my wife.  Sometimes we went for jogging too. During rainy day, I did warm up activities with my family. I also check many different types of workout in you tube. I knew that exercise can lowers stress hormones and prompts the release of feel good endorphins. At the same time, my family and I try to eat healthy well-balanced meals by cooking at home. I will make sure that I have a proper diet too to ensure I maintain my weight. I enjoy eating my lunch and dinner with my kids, wife and parents. I also will request my wife to try new recipes. I ensured that I have enough sleep too. I discovered the one biggest tool last year to manage my own stress is by doing meditation. I practiced as short as 5-10 minutes to¬†as long as¬†an hour. It really helps me to overcome my fear and anxiety ",1
"I am always try my best to find the balance between my job and study with live. Even having a heavy work schedule and studying will inevitably make me to stress out every now and then, but I will try to devote at least 30 minutes of a day to do something that I like to maintain my well-being. I will do some simple exercises twice a week. Sweating make me feel refresh so that I can think more clearly. When I feel down, I will listen to my favourite music and write whatever I feel in a journal. I will feel much better after doing these. It is quite an effective way for me to release tension. ",1
I am glad that I am still alive!,2
"I am satisfied with myself when dealing with the challenges I met as I never choose to give up when I am down or stress. But I think I still have a lot of room for improvement. Life is a non-stop learning process. I will never stop trying, never stop believing, never stop learning and never give up to fulfill my life. ",2
"I believe that by learning Cognitive Psychology, I can overcome few things in my life especially during MCO periods. I noticed that different people have different thinking and perception. Everyone has their own ability and strength to face the challenges. I understand that life has not been the same since the Covid-19 pandemic and MCO, and it will probably not be the same again after, but I believe that I can go through it together. ",2
"I believed that my knowledge in cognitive psychology can help me to cope the challenges that I faced now.  I knew that cognitive psychology¬†is very useful and popular because it can be applied to many fields in¬†psychology, which includes memory, attention, perception, child development, problem solving, eyewitness testimony and gender role development. It also explores internal mental processes such as language, problem solving and memory.¬†After reading the notes and online materials provided by Dr Narina and my friends, I understood about mental capacities such as attention, memory, problem-solving and other useful mental process which are very useful for me during the MCO periods.",2
"I didn't have my breakfast, because woke up late and I rushed to buy few vegetables which requested by my mother. So with empty stomach, I was waited more than 2 hours in a long queue only to buy vegetable. When I back home, it was already near to lunch hour. So I had my lunch earlier to avoid gastric. It was unforgettable day for me. During weekends I woke up at 4 a.m and went earlier to Kluang market to avoid long queue too. I learnt to adjust myself with the new environment.",0
"I faced and overcame a lot of new challenges during MCO. After recalled back, I felt that I have grown up throughout MCO. I found 3 great ways to deal with these challenges.",2
"I felt that I need be stronger to face the challenges. It is because I worried that I cannot cope with those issues if I always under stress. Therefore I must believe myself and my family. First, I must try to overcome my anger during MCO. It is because I always like to argue with my partner. The argument sometimes only due to small matter and it drag my time from focus on my work.  I understood that my mood changed drastically during MCO and I easily got angry with everyone. Therefore I learnt to think before talk anything with my family members. During the heat of the moment, I tried to take a few moments to collect my thoughts before saying anything and allowed my family members involved in the situation to do the same. I also always remind myself that anger won't fix anything and might only make it worse.  I also  avoid to criticize my partner which might only increase my tension  For example, I told my partner about my situation and asked her help too. ",1
"I found that I don't overreact with my challenge. It is because it will cause me to make a bad decision. Therefore, when I face a new challenge, I will try to calm down and relax my mind. Try to solve it with a peaceful way. ",1
"I learnt about propose the idea that creative problem solving involves a process. There are four stages of the process. It is an important information for me to understand the steps so I can guide my students to realize there is problem in the first place, which leads to ideas, which are evaluated and eventually turned into a product. (Mumford et al, 2002)",1
"I love to watch movies or youtube videos (what is in trending around the world).  I will spend two to three hours a day to watch any movies I desire but I will choose comedy or science fiction genre because the intention is to release stress after a long day of doing critical thinking. Furthermore, I love to make jokes to my grandmother and sometimes she entertains with that silly jokes. It is like remedy to myself to see people in your surrounding happy with your presence. Apart from physical and psychological activities to maintain my well-being, as a Muslim we need to pray five times a day and read Quran at least one page a day.  That is the best meditation to keep ourselves insane after having such a long tiring day as we become close to God and wish Him to ease our plans everyday. Conclusion, there is always many ways to make ourselves stay positive, well behave and happy. Our well-being is our own responsibility to take care of and not to torture. ",2
"I manage to cope with my challenges and I started to maintain my well-being. For example, I start doing some work out and simple exercises at home. Exercise is important for my blood circulation. I feel that my body is healthy. Exercise makes me happy too. Besides, I plant some flowers in my garden. I feel that planting is one of my hobbies during MCO. It is because the green plants and flowers boost my mood, productivity, concentration and creativity. It reduces my stress. When I have enough oxygen, I feel extra energy. After that, I can do work more productive. ",2
"I myself learn a lot how to use daydreaming, solitude and meditation to enhance my own creativity. I reflect myself I have an idea when I take a shower or have a walk. After studying Cognitive Psychology, I realize that those actions are really useful and helpful to me when I lack of idea in planning my lesson plan and face any problem in my daily life. I try to let my mind wander so that I can think a better solution. I hope after this continue applying those theories in my daily life. ",2
"I occasionally make a little snack for the children, and i feel very satisfied when i see that the children love it. During the day i will try my best to accompany my four children. They are still very young, eldest is 7 years old and youngest is 3 years old. When i feel bored or unhappy, i will tell my husband or whats app my friends. Spending time with them gives me a sense of being valued and appreciated. Having healthy relationships with your friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors can increase my sense of emotional wellbeing and give me a feeling of connectedness.  ",2
"I understand that a healthy diet is important to help me stay endurance and focus on my work and study. So I am really appreciate for the meals my mum prepared for me everyday. With my parents support, I am surely can cope with my life while juggling work and my study with no doubt.",2
"I understood about student`s situation when they were learning through Google Classroom. They didnt gave more attention because the situation was new for them. Even I think their parents also didnt have knowledge to manage and handle their kids during Google Classroom periods. They really take time to focus and answer my questions. I admitted about the hard times during Google Classroom. Therefore I learnt many ways to grab my student`s attention. During first week of MCO, I gave them a quiz to answer. I prepared a power point slides which I set up with sound effect and funny cartoon animation. If my students failed to answer the question, they will hear a voice to ask them to try again. If they scored the quiz well they will hear clapped sound. The sound effect will make them focus on the work given by me. Even few of the parents called and asked the same type of quiz to be given again. They told me that their kids enjoyed the lesson and wanted to answer the quiz again.",1
"I was so happy when I found out I was able to spend my day meaningfully to all components in my life without neglecting any. Some tips to obey in order to deal with struggling time were assigning time equally, focusing on current task, practicing meditation and do not grumbling. Although I was busy, but I didn‚Äôt feel any uncomfortable in dealing with these. Life will getting better after coping with difficults throughout the life. 
",2
"I will plan ahead. Cramming and writing my essay the night before is the last thing  want to do. University work requires full engagement and concentration! So, prioritizing and planning is my best protection against deadlines creeping up on me. Use that nice journal you bought, or write your tasks down and make a to-do list! Making the effort to keep track of my assignments will not only remind you to complete them on time, but also give you a sense of accomplishment. ",2
"In a nutshell, knowledge about cognitive psychology indeed works for me.",2
"In a way after knowing my own cognition and ability, it does really help me to cope and handle situation. I am kind of person where sometimes I can be multitasking (only if the work given is easy to handle) and sometimes I can‚Äôt. In order for me to complete one task in one specific time, I need to put my full attention and focus into it just to make sure I do my best and the quality of work is satisfied. It is really important to know and make a list of our priorities; family, works and own self. Why is it important to make a to-do-list? As a human, we tend to forget something easily as we do not keep it in our long term memory.  As the things done, then it is. Personally, I will make a to-do-list and give specific time or date when I need to complete it.  It does work to me as I complete all tasks on time without delayed. Besides, it keeps me on track and motivate me to keep going complete them. ",2
"In addition, as a school teacher who is working SJK (T) Kahang, I need to work from home during MCO. As requested by many parents, my school teachers and I provided materials through Google classroom. We prepared the lesson and worksheets earlier before uploading it. But due to unstable internet connection some of my students who are staying in rural area couldn‚Äôt do the homework through Google classroom. Therefore, I prepared some materials and send it through Whatsapp group. Sadly only few completed their homework and others gave many excuses. I was tension due to my student`s behaviour during MCO. I understood most of parents didn‚Äôt have internet connection in their phone. I tried to send some worksheets to my school guard house. Then I called the parents to collect the materials from the guard house. Consequently, during MCO I felt miserable and exhausted.",0
"In addition, I always pray to God. I believe He can arrange the best for me. I trust about ‚ÄúLaw of attraction‚Äù. When I think something positive, it comes positively. Therefore, I always think positive to attract positive energy. ",2
"In addition, I believe to cope my life with work and study, I need to work together with my wife. She is also a teacher, who need to look after our young kids at home. I had a conversation with my partner to overcome the challenges. I think I can manage my work and my studies. We sat and shared about our problem together. We also noticed that we spend most of our time on school work to prepare materials based on lesson plan. After few conversation and discussion, my partner understood about sudden change in life due to Covid-19. We agreed that the situation is not permanent. I tried to help her to look after our kids until she finished her cooking. Then she will help me once our kids take nap. As result we managed to work from home more effectively. ",1
"In addition, I found that I try to understand others cognition. I don't blame my husband for not helping me especially in household chores. I try to understand his cognition and emotion. I always ask myself a question. Why does he react like that?As a result, it fixes the relationship between my husband and I. ",2
"In addition, learning about Default Mode Network (DMN) and mind wandering help me to cope with my challenges too. For example, I take a break and take a shower when I have some arguments with my husband. It helps me to let my mind wander and it brings positive outcomes to me. ",1
"In education, as a teacher, I must be fully aware of a child's cognitive development at different ages. A 6 year-old does not quite have the ability to apply certain math functions to the real-world yet but a 9-year old might. Due to Covid-19, I really took long hours to buy groceries because need to line up and followed standard operation procedure. After few weeks, I decided to buy many things through online. I found the buy things through online is the safest way to keep away from infected by Covid-19. Therefore until now, I prefer to buy things via online. ",1
"In my perspective, everyone needs to understand each others struggles as each of us has our own different kind of struggles to handle every day. Personally, all my lecturers are very understanding same goes to my family members. My lecturers are trying their best to fit in into this new normal where everything need to be online unfortunately sometimes we are facing problem especially with internet connection. There is always a room to discuss and improve our learning activities and processes right after our online classes. So in our side as students we are not feeling left behind or been ignored to pace up with this new normal. I am grateful my mother and grandparents understand my situation and time. I will stay at my uncles room till I finish my work thus throughout that period they allowed me to settle my works and do house chores later on. ",2
"In order to cope with my life, and while juggling work with my study, a systematic and practical plan has to be developed well to pave to a successful pavement.",1
"In studies, I also face different challenges and tests. All along, my English is not good , especially in pronunciation. When one of the assignments needs to be recorded using English, I feel stressed and worried that my performance may affect the team members.

"In the aspect of physical, I maintain exercise daily during MCO. Due to rules of MCO, I cannot jog at parks and playing basketball which is my favourite sport. Therefore, I search some tabata video online to do the exercise at home. I also take care of my food intake during MCO. I tried to prevent intake of oily food and snacks. Vitamin C is a good supplement to increase our antibody to prevent sickness. Exercise and balanced food intake helped me to maintain physically strong during MCO.",1

"Lastly, I would find my own comfort zone with regard to the ideal place and time to study or working. Before this, I have tried to study at living room but to no avail because the attention would not be lasting longer. After many times of discovering, I realize that studying or doing work at my own bedroom with door closed is the best choice. As a result, I won‚Äôt be easily disturbed by the noise and the chit-chat outside.

Effective goal-setting with 5 principals, those are clarity, challenge, commitment, feedback and task complexity. For example, I set a clear goal for myself, that is getting A in cognitive psychology. Then, I plan a schedule for myself and I try to stick to my schedule to studying and working. I keep following up with my group members to make sure our assignment is on the right track and we would give responses about the progress.

"Moreover, I was appointed as an ICT teacher by the school from this year. I was the person who in charge of the school Google classroom system. But I am yet to attend any related courses about the Google classroom. When we were told to create online learning platform via Google classroom, I was asked by my colleagues about how to operate the platform. I have no idea but have to learn by watching some guidance videos through Youtube. Luckily, there are a lot of guidance videos in Youtube which I was able to learn by myself about how to set up students and teachers password for their Google classrooms ID and how to create a new classroom by inviting the participants. All the operations are learned step by step. It is not exaggerate to say that the few days before online teaching class begin, my phone has never stopped ringing. Numerous phone calls and messages from colleagues made me feel stressed as I am also in the learning stage to use the new learning platform but have to help them to solve their problems.",1
"Moreover, I won't leave things to the last minute. I would try settling all the things I could as soon as possible. This is because I am an absent-minded person so I would do the things right now once I get the instruction. I also believe that the performance would be lower neither on work nor on study when I burning the midnight oil for studying or working. Instead of staying up all night, I prefer to sleep earlier and wake up earlier to finish my works. This is because my brain cannot function well and think deeper and further if I am feeling drowsy.",1

"Movement Control Order (MCO) started during school holidays which is 18 March 2020. My mother and I were planned to stay at our hometown in Batu Pahat during school holidays. Therefore, we went to hometown on 16 March. As the cases arise from day to day, government decided to announce MCO on 18 of March. The moment Prime Minister announced all citizens were not allowed to go out and need to stay where you have stay during that time till the next announcement, to be honest I was shocked and panic. My mind was questioned with so many thoughts. What will happen to my study? I haven't settled my works yet. How am I going to settle all that if I am here? The challenges I have to face throughout MCO are internet connectivity and time. My hometown is located at Parit Raja, Batu Pahat. There are only several areas that have strong internet connectivity and depends on what telco you use. Usually I will start doing my works and university assignments after morning prayer as that was the strongest internet connectivity I can get and will stop around 11am. Another reason why I do my works after morning prayer is because my brain is still fresh and can work efficiently. Besides, I need to find a spot to place my laptop where it has the strongest internet connectivity which is my uncle's room. Sometimes I need to attend online classes which required me to stay in front of laptop for a quite long time. ",0
"My biggest challenges that I faced during MCO was dealing with my new circuit of life , that was a phase which called Work-From-Home. This story had to begin from 18th March 2020. ",1
"My everyday routines during MCO is I clean up the house such as vacuuming, mopping and brushing the toilets.  This is how I maintain my well-being by seeing my environment clean and clear. To be honest, I can stress out if the house is full with dusts, toilet is dirty and kitchen is messed up. Who loves to stay in that kind of environment, right? To keep myself insane and well behave thus I need to take the responsibility to make sure everything pleasant to my eyes.  Besides, cleaning the house is like physical exercise to make myself sweating and healthy because sometimes I am just too lazy to jog around hometown (but actually it is fun as the weather is cold and breezy). Thus I take around 30 minutes to one hour thrice a week just to sweeping, vacuuming and mopping the house. ",1
"My family and I are doing fine at home and we have not yet faced any burnout problem. I have arranged daily teaching schedules for my teachers. I also teach English, and with the schedule, it is easier for me to manage house chores before starting my e-learning session with the kids. So far, this arrangement has been going well. We also appreciate parents commitment to our e-learning session. They have been very supportive in preparing the kids and the learning materials according to the schedule prepared by our teachers.",2
"My group is consisted of 4 members with 3 different ethnics, which are 2 Chinese, one Malay and one Indian. Some more, we are from different places and teaching at different schools. Since the MCO starts, we have been forced to halt face-to-face classes and this causes us lack of time to be together to discuss and brainstorming in doing our assignment. Thus, we have to complete assignment from home by using online chat to discuss. However, everyones schedule and responsibility in live is quite distinct. We have to play many roles in daily life and we are overwhelmed with many duties every day. For example, as teachers we have to conduct Google Classroom, assign the homework via Telegram or WhatsApp, carry out ladap, preparing materials for students and so on. Meanwhile, one from my group member who is a wife and also a mother bears heavy responsibility, such as she has to do house chores, cooking, looking after her children and guides her children.

"Online classes was a big challenge, I had to pay more vision and hearing attention than normal level because I had to take note from the speech of professor. Missed any single sentence of professor was harder because I did not have any classmate sit beside me as usual. All I could do was just marking down the missing part and discuss with classmate after all. ",0
"opportunity to learn this technology. In the process, I often encourage myself to try and try again. In the end, not only did I learn to use Google Classroom, I also have the ability to help my students in solving some technical problems. I also no longer feel stressed. In fact, I feel that learning new knowledge is actually quite good. I also no longer find send messages to parents is a challenge because it is my responsibility. As long as I am willing to change my mind by having the knowledge of cognitive psychology, the result will become different, just like Donderss Pioneering Experiment indicated that mental responses cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from observing behavior. Our mind can change our learning attitude and behaviors",1
"Perception is experiences resulting from stimulation of the senses. To know about perception, I realize that how perception can involve a process similar to reasoning or problem solving. For example, I realize I need some individual space where I can relax my mind. My perception was my experience in university. I was an undergraduate student and it was my final year. I rushed with my thesis on that time. I felt stressful and depressed. I tried a way to relax myself where I had my personal time and did whatever I like to do. The result was good because I really can relax and mind. After relaxing my mind, I had more ideas about my thesis. This experience was my perception. Hence, I learned from my experience where I have to find my own time and space. This perception helps me to solve one of my challenge. ",2

"Reading also can temporarily distract all of the trivial affairs and reduce stress. Reading a well-written novel can transport me to other realms, while an engaging article would distract me and keep me in the present moment, letting tensions drain away and allowing me to relax.

I communicated and told my problem and stress level to him. I hope he can understand me better and help me in household chores. After the conversation, it works.

We have to be mindful and care of partners stress and problems. As a result, it heals our relationship. ",2
"Sometimes my students send Whatsapp and I replied it in order for them to complete their homework. That's why I need to spend most of my time by messaging and uploading materials. But my wife didn't understand about it.  She also said I didn't help her to take care our kids. I think she didn't understand my role as a front liner. We argued a lot during MCO when I was unable to buy fresh vegetables as what she wanted. Both of us need to complete our assignments and must do revision to face the examination. So it was really a hectic life for me as a head of family, as a master student of UTM and as a father of two young children who are 6 and 4 years old. ",0

"The factors of making online teaching difficult were the lack of technology supply, the students age and competent, and the parents. In order to help parents and students, I surveyed again the pedagogy of teaching and I found out an application, Kahoot Quiz Game. The exercise was transformed in pattern of game with a lot of animation and colour which attracting students very much. ",1
"The first day to start virtual learning with students was hard, and it became smooth and succeed after couple of days by changing the method of pedagogy. The problem was the method in transmitting information, so I just focused on looking alternative method to transmit knowledge to students. At the end, I found the method, Kahoot Quiz Game. But, creating the quiz game wasn't easy. I had to prepare a lot of graphic information because preschooler addicted to image more than words. How much were preschooler understand the knowledge was a preceded important point before doing any quiz game. I perceive myself able to deal with this challenge was the moment when I abled to record teaching video, create quiz game, handle student's question and homework in shorter time. I felt so relieved when I already can handle a new teaching skill.   ",1
"The first step I chose to aware the challenges instead of run away from them. The article mentioned Look at each problem individually, decide which problems you can't change, and identify the ones you can change.Therefore, I prepared to-do-list to list down every challenges clearly. The challenges were arranged from the most difficult to the easier depends on my capability. After I understood the challenges clearly, I would not feel afraid of them.",1
The life during MCO was rather chaotic. ,0
"The most important part that I perceive myself dealing with those challenges is I have to accept the moment reality. The reality that it is during MCO and everyone has to stay at home and work from home. I know it's stressful on certain things but when I slowly accept the reality, I realize that everything went smooth. It is not that hard time for me during MCO. ",1
"The multitask simultaneous  attention was useful on the spot and it helped me to take note, listening, finding information via online and so on during this virtual class. ",0
"The recent relaxing of MCO will be welcomed by many. We know that staying home helps save life, but it can be difficult to spend so long in one place. However the changes to the MCO are unlikely to solve our problems. We must concerned about our health and stay psychologically healthy during the Covid-19 pandemic. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it`s completely normal to feel emotions such as fear, frustration, anger, loneliness, sadness, boredom or even joy and happiness. However I feel that our emotions can become a problem if we let them push us around. ",0
"The second challenge is time. I have to divide my time wisely with works, study and house chores. My intention when I was in hometown is to help my grandparents clean up the house. My uncle built up a big house for them as a gift to make them feel comfortable and happy. At the age of 70 and 85 years old, both of them do not have much energy to clean up the house. Thus, I take the responsibility to help them. My thought is I go back to hometown once a week or once a month instead of I complain the house is dirty and full with dusts why don't I take the chance to gain pahala helping them clean up? Therefore, I need to schedule my time wisely so that I can settle all my duties. ",1
"The second step was to accept the challenges. After my mentality well prepared, I encountered those challenges positively. The article stated that Gain perspective by comparing the challenges and focus on those that are changeable.‚ From the statement, I found that change in my personal attitude to accept the challenges. In my opinion, I cannot run away from challenges, but I can change my attitude to accept them. Therefore, I remained positive to the challenges and accepted challenges as tasks of my daily life.",1
"The teacher has feelings of low personal fulfillment. This is characterized by a feeling of failure at the workplace and in their personal life. Their work relationships are inefficient, most of the time having the impression of not being able to control any situation let alone the students. This tends  to  develop  into  helplessness,  defeat  and anxiety  symptoms.  It  implies  emotional exhaustion.  It's  usually  followed  by  sadness  and  feelings  of  defeat.  It's  common  for  these emotions to have physiological outlets, presented by insomnia, headaches and upset stomach. Teacher  burnout  leads  to  symptoms  of  Depersonalization.  Feeling  useless  and  incapable  of getting through the  day, the teacher tends  to draw away from routine.   Becomes distant with coworkers and students and can't do much about it or doesn't realize this is happening. This can lead to missing many days from college and even depression.",0
"The very first thing to maintain my welfare is reading every day. As the saying goes, knowledge is power. Reading can fill my head with new bits of information, widen my horizon, and enlarge my understanding. I also believe that everything might be taken including my job, my possession and my money but just knowledge can never be taken. Thus, I used to reading after waking up and before taking breakfast because that is the freshest moment for me to gain the knowledge as many as I could. I would feel happy and satisfied when I discovering something new. Let's say about the lighted trail of sparkle. I assumed that the lighted trail is created by light left by the sparkle, however, it is because of a creation of our mind, persistence of vision. This shows that how the knowledge can successfully nourish my spirit.",2
"The way we perceive situation is never truly objective. Each of us has our own filters and explanatory styles which skew our point of views of the world. Each challenges come with different solutions.  In fact, challenges come to make us better in dealing with problem and know how to overcome it well. Throughout the MCO period I keep doing mostly the same activities which required me to apply the same method in solving problems. I will always ask myself how to improve if I am not doing my best in certain things. For example, I have quizzes and lecturer give each quizzes two attempts. I scored 12/20 for my first attempt thus what I need to do for my second attempt is I need to read notes, revise the questions and ask friends terms that I don't understand.  As I take my second attempt, I scored 18/20. It is better than the first one right? Same as we apply to our daily life. There is always plan A till Z. If A doesn't work, we still have 25 alphabets left to plan our life. ",1
"The Wright brothers illustrates that ideas depend on having a base of knowledge. Therefore, set induction is a very crucial step in my teaching life. A good set induction can generate their prior knowledge about a topic. For example, I always show a video clip or pictures to stimulate their thinking. When the students are set, they are ready to learn. As a result, the students have the right mind-set to learn. Set induction is a very important step to brainstorm the students. When the students realize the problem, it leads to a better idea throughout the lesson. ",1
"There are a lot of challenges that I have faced throughout MCO. The biggest challenge is about dealing with my students and my kids. I feel my maximum stress level. This stress level due to my work. I need to work from home. It is not easy because I have two kids at home. They are young. My eldest daughter is four years old and my youngest son is one year old. I need to take care of them and at the same time, I have to teach at home. Besides, the Wifi at my home is not supportive and unstable. Some of my students who live in rural area couldn‚Äôt have online learning at home too. This issue increases my stress level because not all of my students can learn what I have taught on that day. They missed the lesson so I have to repeat the lesson. I always think of the alternative and creative way to teach them better during MCO. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt find any. Some of my students will text me anytime to ask questions. I need to reply their text even late at night. It is like working 24 hours per day. I feel exhausted because I need to see the handphone all the time. Sometimes I have insomnia due to the stress. It affects my mental health too.",0
"There are a lot of difficulties, I faced during movement control order. As a leader of my family, I was a front liner who went out daily. When I heard that Kluang was under red zone in Johor with 56 cases, I was worried and stressed up. I was worried about my children, wife and my parent`s health. They really need my help to go through the challenging time during movement control order (MCO). I also faced hard times after Malaysian Government only allowed head of family to go out to purchase daily essentials and medication during the movement control order periods. This was a testing periods for me because I always went out with my wife to purchase groceries and other needs. So now I went out alone by holding a list of things that I need to buy. ",0
"There are numerous practical applications for this cognitive research, such as providing help coping with memory disorders, increasing¬†decision-making¬†accuracy, finding ways to help people recover from brain injury, treating learning disorders, and structuring educational curricula to enhance learning.",1
"Therefore, I woke up early morning to buy groceries. This is because if I moved late, there will be a long queue and it took longer time than before to buy things. I also must prepared extra precaution such as wearing face mask and bring my own hand sanitizer to keep away from Covid-19 which will spread easily. I felt panicked sometimes if can`t find things from the prepared list. I need to search in different shops to ensure I was able to buy all the things in the list. I also was stress up when I went to Song Mart near Jalan Duku, Kluang because I waited more than 2 hours to buy vegetables. ",0
These are the challenges that I have to face and to overcome.,1
"These challenges had bothered me throughout the MCO period until I started to do my revision in the course cognitive psychology. When I read the cognitive psychology book, I was learnt about the topic of attention. This topic helps me in cope with my challenges when during MCO period. I have learnt about attention allows us to stay focused on a task for a certain period of time, even in the face of distraction. After I learnt about the cognitive psychology, I just realise that people actually can attend to more than one thing at a time but it need depends on a number of factors, including practice and the difficulty of the task. The experiments by Walter Schneider and Richard Shiffrin (1977) had show that practice made it possible for participants to divide their attention to deal with all of the target and test items simultaneously. Furthermore, the many trials of practice resulted in automatic processing, a type of processing that occurs (1) without intention (it happens automatically without the person intending to do it) and (2) at a cost of only of person's cognitive resources. So, I think it is possible for me to divided my attention when I do some well-practice tasks but it is difficult to divided attention when the task is made too hard for me. Apart from this, after I learnt about cognitive psychology, I also found out the reason I often consult my cell phone. That is my behaviour involves operant conditioning, a type of learning named by behaviourist B.F. Skinner (1938), in which behaviour is controlled by rewards (called reinforcements) that follow behaviour. So, that is why when I check my phone for a message and it's not there, well, there's always a chance it will be there the next time. And when it eventually appears, I've been intermittently reinforced, which strengthens future phone-clickling behaviour. According to Steven Pinker (2010), given that the computer and Internet are here to say, ‚Äúthe solution is not to bemoan technology, but develop strategies of self-control, as we do with every other temptation in life.‚Äù Besides that, I also found out I always mind wandering while reading or doing work. This also one of the factors made me decreases my performance when doing my work. ",2
"Third, i will take intermittent breaks when i feel pressured during MCO. However, it is vital that you do not overextend yourself. Taking intermittent breaks throughout the day will help me feel refreshed. Take a nap when i need to or spend some time watching some good movies and even started binge-watching several good series.",1
"Thirdly, I realize that I need my personal space where I can relax my mind. During MCO there is a lot of time spend with my family members. It is a good thing but too much of time sometimes I may feel annoying. Therefore, a personal space is essential as I can spend the time with only myself. My husband needs to respect my individual space and so do I. For example, I do some workout at a small corner of my house. I bake a cake too. I discover I can bake a cake too. Before that, I never think of I can bake a cake but I did it during MCO. With my personal space or time, I become happier. As a result, I do my work effectively. ",2
"Those challenges make my imbalance life. I realize that it is unhealthy and I must think a way to solve it. It is not easy to be a housewife, mother, student and teacher at the same time. However, I must do something to cope with my life. Firstly, I acknowledge the root of the problem which is the time management. I feel stress because I couldn't manage my time well. I have argument with my husband due to my poor time management too. Therefore, I have my own timetable to manage my time. For example, I need to wake up early to settle my kids. After that, I need to arrange two hours lesson for my students. Then, I have to cook lunch.

"Throughout the MCO, I had faced many challenges in my life in many aspects included changes of my daily life, work and my study. My daily routine was interrupted because I cannot go for work as usual, I need to stay at home and work from home. Moreover, when the Ministry of Health announced that there were 138 residents who tested positive for COVID-19 in Simpang Renggam, that is the place where I lived, it made my parents always worry about the spread of coronavirus in my place and they also bought a lot of daily necessities due to believe in the fake news about lockdown of my hometown.

In other words, cognitive psychology is reflect in what is happening within my minds that links stimulus (input) and response (output).  People do have different ways of reasoning if we think about why people buy certain things when they shop. My wife can reason that it is okay to buy an expensive shirt for a child because it is higher quality where I might reason that he is going to outgrow it too fast anyway and it wouldn't make sense to spend that much money on a shirt. Our ability to solve problems has to do with cognitive brain functions. For example if my car broken, I can go through a checklist of things which I am familiar with that might allow me to figure out what exactly is causing the problem.",2

"To me, yes. Having knowledge about cognitive psychology enables me to understand about creative problem solving which could help me to cope with the challenges that I faced now. According to Duncker (1945) & Lovett (2002), a problem occurs when there is an obstacle between a present state and a goal and it is not immediately obvious how to get around the obstacle. Functional fixedness is one of the obstacle to problem solving which people's tendency to focus on a specific characteristic of the problem that keeps them from arriving at a solution. By knowing the obstacle to problem solving, I am able to avoid myself from presenting such mental set and will try to adopt the correct problem representation in order to solve a problem successfully. Besides, I have learned from solving my problem with creativity. Creative problem solving is associated with divergent thinking. When I faced with the challenges, I should open my mind to think outside the box to explore and evaluate new methods to solve complex problems and not fix myself in a certain way. ",2

So I have to think and plan the whole case-based research proposal personally first such as problem statement, the approach that can be used to solve the problem, what the composition of the proposal and so on, before I could discuss and sharing idea in the group. Learning cognitive psychology provides numerous practical applications to resolve the problem and increase decision-making accuracy. For instance, I need to keep thinking about the problem presented in my mind when I face it in planning the proposal. Then, I need to think whether this way makes sense and reasoning the effect of this way. If cannot make it, I have to change to another way of thinking and repeat reasoning until come out with a proper plan. In last, I can make the best decision by considering all of the aspects. This method of problem-solving is based on the Gestalt Approach in which the main focus is mainly about how people represent a problem in their mind and also how solving a problem involves reorganization or reconstructing of this representation. Every members share their own idea and discussing in the group is a good approach to save time and smooth the discussion process.",1

"Yes, it does. Learning cognitive psychology helps me a lot to cope with the challenges that I am facing now. In cognitive psychology, the biggest word is cognitive.

"Yes, it is. I can say that most of the challenges I am facing now is related to cognitive psychology that I have learnt since in degree time till master degree. It is still applicable and relevant to apply in our daily life. All those challenges and abnormal situations I have been facing everyday is a cognition in emergency where it has been expressed throughout the history of psychology as an independent discipline which concerned about performance of people in extraordinary conditions. According to Dearnaley and Warr (1979), emergency situations are always dynamics as decisions made by participants determine the environment in which subsequent decisions must be made. Emergencies are time-dependent because any decisions must be made at the correct moment. Emergencies also are stressful because they can create intense psychological pressures to participants. My personal point of view, each of us need the emergency or stressful situation to push ourselves getting our workloads done. On the negative side, people always perform badly in emergencies situation and neglecting quality of the work. For example, I have an assignment to submit end of this week but I did nothing even a draft or workflow of the assignment as well. So I start doing the assignment two days before the dateline. With this kind of emergency situation and I am getting stressful because of limitation of time, I started to ignore all the respond and qualities of the works that need to be considered. Thus with this kind of reflection and knowledge that I have learnt in cognitive psychology teach me how to handle stressful situation and the most important thing is not to put myself in a stress mode. Start doing work now not later. Moreover, I need to put my 100% attention unto my current works. Being multitasking is good sometimes but not all human can be multitasking and complete all works in one time. As mentioned before, the importance of to-do-list and plan your next day so I will know exactly what need to be done urgently. ",1
